                    I am an amateur full-stack developer who recently relocated to the Charlotte, NC area. Originally I was born in Rochester, New York before my family relocated to Charlotte where attended grade school through high school. I graduated high school in Charlotte in 2011 and pursued a degree in Communication Studies at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In college I participated in the surrounding area arts community performing in shows in places such as Raleigh, Chapel Hill, Durham and more. I studied there for three years before leaving to open my own restaurant in Greensboro, North Carolina. The prospect of running and managing my own business fascinated but was unfortunately cut short when I had to step down in order to handle family business that brought me back to Charlotte. In Charlotte I have had the oppurtunity to participate in UNCC and Trilogy Educations Coding Bootcamp and I have become fascinated with computer programming and development. I've been a lifelong fan of puzzles, games (video and board) and have found that coding in many respects appeals to that part of me.
